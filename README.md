# ESP32-Automatic-Optical-Audio-Switch
This project is an automatic optical audio switch for TOSLINK / SPDIF signals, based on an ESP32-C3 microcontroller. It allows two optical audio sources to be connected to a single optical output and automatically selects the active input based on signal detection — without any manual interaction.
